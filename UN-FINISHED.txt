The project is still incomplete, due to an unexpected hardware failure,
i need to buy some tools which i used to have available when building the hardware (which now i don't)  
in order to fix the hardware problem and then continue with the control software.
The control software was one of the things that i really hoped to learn and achieve with this project,but the progress made so far is quite good, and everything 
managed to work to a satisfactory degree up to this point,
but until i can find the required  tools and time to fix the issue and continue with the control algorithm, the project remains unfinished.
